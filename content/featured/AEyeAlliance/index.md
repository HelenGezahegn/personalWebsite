Using a specific ratio and cropping function, we are able to take an image of a sentence/line of Braille and segment each Braille character out individually. We feed each of these characters into our model and then concatenate the output characters together into an English sentence or word. The main objectives of this project are to raise awareness of Braille and to bridge the gap of communication between blind and non-blind people.
