A mouse-free way to browse the web that can aid those that are physically unable to operate a standard mouse. With the help of XESTO and Hack the North, we were given access to a Leap Motion Controller. This special piece of hardware allows its users to utilize hand and finger gestures as input that would be analogous to a computer mouse or touchpad.
